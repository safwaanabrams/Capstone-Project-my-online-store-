## What is this Capstone project?
Here I will briefly explain the Capstone project and the idea behind it. Prior to this project, we were tasked with learning the basics in HTML,CSS,JavaScript 
and Jquery. All of which played a pivotol role in the creation of this project. This project includes my online store, an online eCommerce platform where you
can purchase your favourite memorabilia, merchandise and most important your favourite albums.My bands name is The Generics, comprising of myself and my 2 brothers.

## How does My online store work?
Simply go to the following link( file:///C:/Users/safwaan.abrams/Desktop/one.html), this will direct you to the online store, this page contains some information
about The Generics. In the nav bar you can move easily between pages, the next page is the Home page, here you can view our upcoming events and schedules. The next page 
is the Store page where you can view albums and merchandise available for purchase. Simply select your item/s and see your total in the view cart. The next page is
the actual Cart page, here you can add and remove selected items and also see the discount code. The middle to bottom of this page has some cool Jquery actions for 
your pleasure and amusement. The last page is the Shipping page which provides you with a billing and shipping form. Here you can enter your discount codes if applicable
and simply wait while we package and send your purchase through to you all in the comfort of your home.

## Installation?
This installation section tells users how to install the project locally:
*First You have to create an account on Github.
*Open up Git Bash. This shows your working directory. Change my working directory to the Desktop using cd command
*we're going to use the "git clone" command to clone the GitHub repository.
*You simply type "git clone" and then the URL of the repo. How do you get that URL? I recommend that you go to the repo and click the "Copy" button. 
Now go back to Git Bash, and paste it and "enter". (Here you can select the SSH or HTTPS URL depending on which one you use).
*Enter your password and The cloning operation is now complete. It has copied the repo into a subdirectory of your working directory, and that subdirectory has the same name 
as the repo.
*To see the list of files,  just use git "cd" into "test-repo" and git "ls" to see the list of files.

## Who can use this code, including screenshots of project in action?
This code is easy enough for beginners to advanced users of git and github. The code is written in Sublime text editor.
